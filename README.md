# cvector
A simple vector implementation for the C language.

**Still under development.**

Tested on Windows 10 using MinGW-w64 (gcc 8.1.0 x86_64-posix-seh-rev0) only.

A simple project configuration for Visual Studio Code is available.

A minimal makefile is also available, but it still needs some work.
