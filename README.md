# cvector
A simple vector implementation for the C language.

Configuration files for working with Visual Studio Code (compiling, debugging, code completion) are available.

A simple makefile is also available, allowing the examples and shared lib to be built directly using `make` (work in progress).

Currently developed and tested on Windows 10 using MinGW-w64 (gcc 8.1.0 x86_64-posix-seh-rev0) only.
